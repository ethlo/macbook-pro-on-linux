<h2>Macbook Pro linux scripts</h2>

A small collection of scripts I use to setup Ubuntu Gnome(http://ubuntugnome.org/) 14.10+ on my Macbook Pro Retina.

Add a link to the scripts you want to use in ```/etc/rc.local```.

<h2>Issues</h2>
- Still not as good battery life as OSX
- Some applications not ready for HiDpi (Eclipse, Chrome/Chromium, etc)
